Max zipped up his tent, hoping it would hold.
Raindrops tapped like fingers on the canvas above him.
Pip, his small dog, curled up close, trembling.
A flash of lightning lit up the forest, followed by a deep rumble.
"It's just a storm," Max whispered.
He reached for his flashlight and clicked it on.
The light flickered once, then stayed steady.
Max smiled. "We're okay, Pip. Just us, the rain, and the night."
Outside, the storm rolled on.`
